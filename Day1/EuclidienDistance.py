# Program to find the Euclidien Distance between any 2 points
# Initializing the variables
PointA = (2,3)
PointB = (10,8)

# Process the inputs, Calculating the Euclidien Distance
DistanceBtwAandB = ((PointB[0]-PointA[0])**2 + (PointB[1]-PointA[1])**2)**0.5

# Print the Output, Print the Distance
print (float(DistanceBtwAandB))
